### Scientific Research
Currently I am interested in stochastic algorithms (e.g. _stochastic gradient method_, _ADMM_ and _proximal point algorithm_) for solving the non-smooth convex/nonconvex programming problems arising in machine learning, statistical learning, image processing and so forth. Wellcome to my official homepage 'https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/jcbai' for more details.
