### Research Interests
Currently I am interested in stochastic algorithms (e.g. _stochastic gradient method_, _ADMM_ and _proximal point algorithm_, _primal-dual method_) for solving the `non-smooth convex/nonconvex` programming problems arising in machine learning, statistical learning, image processing and so forth. Wellcome to [my official homepage](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/jcbai) for more details.
