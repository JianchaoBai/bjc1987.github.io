# Research
Summary

Currently I am interested in stochastic algorithms (e.g. stochastic gradient method, ADMM and proximal point algorithm) for solving the non-smooth convex/nonconvex programming problems arising in machine learning, statistical learning, image processing and so forth. Wellcome to my official homepage https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/jcbai for more details.
